# ALU-for-Complex-Numbers

This experiment involves implementing and testing various components required to construct a simple, custom computer architecture. The final system uses a memory unit with 32 words.

### üß± Modules to Implement

#### ‚ûï A. Complex Number Addition and Subtraction
- Design a module that supports both addition and subtraction of complex numbers.
- Input: Two complex numbers
- Output: Sum or difference

#### ‚úñÔ∏è B. Complex Number Multiplication
- Design a module to multiply two complex numbers.
- Ensure proper handling of real and imaginary parts.

#### üì• C. Pipelined Execution Unit
- Build a pipelined unit to:
  - Fetch instructions from the 32-word memory.
  - Execute complex operations in a pipelined fashion.
- The unit must support streaming execution without stalling.
